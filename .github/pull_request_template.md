### Summary

Provide a general description of the code changes in your pull
request... were there any bugs you had fixed? If so, mention them. If
these bugs have open GitHub issues, be sure to tag them here as well,
to keep the conversation linked together.


### Testing Steps

Provide steps to test functionality, described in detail for someone not familiar with this part of the application / code base


### Other Information

If there's anything else that's important and relevant to your pull
request, mention that information here. This could include
benchmarks, or other information.

Thanks for contributing to Dradis!


### Copyright assignment

Collaboration is difficult with commercial closed source but we want
to keep as much of the OSS ethos as possible available to users
who want to fix it themselves.

In order to unambiguously own and sell Dradis Framework commercial
products, we must have the copyright associated with the entire
codebase. Any code you create which is merged must be owned by us.
That's not us trying to be a jerks, that's just the way it works.

You can delete this section, but the following sentence needs to
remain in the PR's description:

> I assign all rights, including copyright, to any future Dradis
> work by myself to Security Roots.
